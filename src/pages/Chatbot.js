    { question: "Hello", answer: "Hi there! How can I help you with makeup today?" },
    { question: "What is the best foundation for oily skin?", answer: "For oily skin, a matte, oil-free foundation works best. Try products labeled as 'matte' or 'long-wear'." },
    { question: "What foundation is good for dry skin?", answer: "For dry skin, go for a hydrating or dewy foundation to keep your skin moisturized throughout the day." },
    { question: "How do I choose the right lipstick shade?", answer: "Choose a lipstick shade based on your skin tone. Warm undertones go well with reds and oranges, while cool undertones match pinks and purples." },
    { question: "What is the difference between BB cream and foundation?", answer: "BB cream is lighter and offers more natural coverage, while foundation is used for fuller coverage and a more polished look." },
    { question: "How do I apply eyeliner?", answer: "For a classic look, use a pencil or liquid liner close to your lash line, starting from the inner corner of the eye and drawing outward." },
    { question: "How can I make my makeup last all day?", answer: "Use a primer before applying makeup, set it with a setting powder, and finish with a setting spray." },
    { question: "What is a good skincare routine before applying makeup?", answer: "Cleanse your face, apply moisturizer, and use a primer to create a smooth base for makeup." },
    { question: "What is the best way to remove makeup?", answer: "Use a gentle makeup remover or micellar water, followed by a cleanser to ensure all makeup is removed." },
    { question: "How do I contour my face?", answer: "To contour, use a matte bronzer along the hollows of your cheeks, sides of your nose, and jawline, and a highlighter on the high points of your face like the cheekbones and nose bridge." },
    { question: "How do I highlight my cheekbones?", answer: "Apply a highlighter above your cheekbones in a C-shape to add a natural glow to your face." },
    { question: "What are the best makeup brands?", answer: "Some top makeup brands include Fenty Beauty, MAC Cosmetics, NARS, and Too Faced." },
    { question: "How do I choose the right concealer shade?", answer: "Pick a concealer shade that is 1-2 shades lighter than your skin tone for brightening, or match it to your skin tone for covering blemishes." },
    { question: "How can I make my lips look fuller?", answer: "Overline your lips slightly with a lip liner, then apply lipstick. A gloss in the center of your lips can also create the illusion of fuller lips." },

    { question: "What is the best mascara for volume?", answer: "For volume, try mascaras with a thick, full brush like Maybellineâ€™s Lash Sensational or Too Faced Better Than Sex." },
    { question: "How do I apply false lashes?", answer: "Apply lash glue along the lash band, wait a few seconds for it to get tacky, then carefully place the lashes as close to your natural lashes as possible." },
    { question: "What is a makeup primer?", answer: "A primer creates a smooth surface for makeup application and helps your makeup last longer." },
    { question: "How do I choose the right blush?", answer: "Pick a blush shade that complements your skin tone: peach for warm tones, pink for cool tones, and rose or berry for neutral tones." },
    { question: "How do I prevent makeup from settling into fine lines?", answer: "Use a hydrating primer and lightweight foundation, and avoid applying too much product to avoid settling into fine lines." },
    { question: "What is dewy makeup?", answer: "Dewy makeup has a fresh, glowing finish, achieved with hydrating products and a bit of highlighter." },
    { question: "How do I stop my eyeliner from smudging?", answer: "Use a long-wear eyeliner, and set it with a matching eyeshadow to prevent smudging." },
    { question: "How do I keep my makeup from melting?", answer: "Use mattifying primer, long-wear foundation, and setting spray to help your makeup stay in place throughout the day." },
    { question: "What is the best makeup remover?", answer: "Micellar water, oil-based cleansers, and makeup wipes are all great options for removing makeup effectively." },
    { question: "What is a setting spray?", answer: "A setting spray locks your makeup in place and helps it last longer without fading or transferring." },
    { question: "How do I fix a broken lipstick?", answer: "Melt the broken pieces with a lighter and press them back together, or melt and pour the lipstick into a new container." },
    { question: "What is the best makeup for beginners?", answer: "Start with a basic foundation, mascara, neutral eyeshadow, and lip gloss or lipstick for a simple, everyday look." },
    { question: "What is the best way to organize makeup?", answer: "Use makeup organizers or acrylic drawers to keep your makeup tidy and easy to access." }
